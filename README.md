# IoT-based-Health-Monitoring-System-for-Diabetics

In this project, we present an innovative solution in the form of an IoT-based Non-Invasive Health Monitoring System for Diabetics. Our system addresses two critical Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3) and Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9). It revolutionizes the way individuals manage their health by offering a stand-alone medical kit that combines multiple non-invasive sensors into a single, user-friendly device. This comprehensive medical kit includes a glucometer for measuring blood sugar levels, an SpO2 sensor to monitor oxygen saturation, a temperature sensor for tracking body temperature, and a BPM sensor for heart rate measurement. The seamless integration of these sensors empowers people to effortlessly monitor their vital signs, providing a new level of health awareness and control. Crucially, our system is augmented by a dedicated mobile application, Med X kit, compatible with both iOS and Android operating systems. Med X kit enables users to track their vital signs, manage their prescription history, and maintain a personal health journal, fostering a holistic approach to health management. Our preliminary testing has yielded around 95% accurate results with the non-invasive glucometer, for fasting measurements, for both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Additionally, our design shows real-time readings for SpO2, BPM, and body temperature, further showcasing the potential of our system to empower individuals to take charge of their health. In an era of rapid technological advancement and shifting health priorities, our IoT-based Non-Invasive Health Monitoring System for Diabetics represents an innovative approach to promoting good health and well-being.
